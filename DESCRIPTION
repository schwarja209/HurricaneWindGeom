Description: The purpose of this project was to demonstrate understanding of the topics covered in
    the Building Data Visualization Tools course in the Masterin Software Development in R
    specialization on Coursera, offered by Johns Hopkins University. To do this I created a series
    of functions that are meant to solve the following problem (as stated in the course): "Hurricanes can have asymmetrical wind fields, with much higher winds on one side of a storm
    compared to the other. Hurricane wind radii report how far winds of a certain intensity (e.g.,
    34, 50, or 64 knots) extended from a hurricane's center, with separate values given for the
    northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest quadrants of the storm. The 34 knot radius in
    the northeast quadrant, for example, reports the furthest distance from the center of the storm
    of any location that experienced 34-knot winds in that quadrant. This wind radii data provides a clearer picture of the storm structure than the simpler
    measurements of a storm's position and maximum winds. For example, if a storm was moving very
    quickly, the forward motion of the storm might have contributed significantly to wind speeds
    to the right of the storm's direction of forward motion, and wind radii might be much larger
    for the northeast quadrant of the storm than the northwest quadrant. These wind radii are
    available for Atlantic basin tropical storms since 1988 through the Extended Best Track dataset,
    available [here](http://rammb.cira.colostate.edu/research/tropical_cyclones/tc_extended_best_track_dataset/)."
